# sparsity-based-face-recognition

This repository implements Superposed Sparse Representation Classification described in [1] and Semi-supervised Sparse Representation Classification described in [2]. The package `SSGMM` used in Semi-supervised_SRC.ipynb is installed following the guidance of https://github.com/rrricharrrd/semi_supervised.
